My research vision is to **automate cyberspace operations(CO)**. The scope of CO is growing exponentially. For example, Google play store adds [3739](https://appinventiv.com/blog/google-play-store-statistics/) apps every day. On the contrary, the cyber community faces a severe shortage of experts. My research includes a portfolio of offensive, defensive, and data science techniques; Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to automate hunting and hardening of hosts, and a software-defined network that restructures logically to counter the adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP).
