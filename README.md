My research vision is to **automate cyberspace operations(CO)**. The scope of CO is growing exponentially. Google play store adds [3739](https://appinventiv.com/blog/google-play-store-statistics/) apps every day. On the contrary, the cyber community faces a severe shortage of experts. My research includes a portfolio of offensive and defensive techniques; Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to automate hunting and hardening. ML-enabled software-defined network restructures logically to counter the adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP).
